## Notes for future consideration

This project was originally started to learn more about datalog, and in particular LogicBlox's implementation. Along the way it also provided me an excuse to learn about Parser Combinators (nom is most of the way to something I like for this). 

While this was a useful experiment for learning about datalog and rust, the LogicBlox system is intended for a very different use case than what I have in mind for urql. I'll leave this up for a bit, but this will eventually be completely replaced once I have time to puzzle out a datalog engine that better fits what I'd like urql to be used for.
